# PoolTurn - Decentralized Community Savings Platform

PoolTurn is a blockchain-based Rotating Savings and Credit Association (PoolTurn) platform that enables secure community savings circles with collateral protection. Built on Base Mainnet with a modern Next.js frontend.

## üåü Features

### Smart Contract (Solidity)

- **Collateral Protection**: Members lock collateral to ensure payment commitments
- **Rotation-based Payouts**: Deterministic winner selection without randomness
- **Insurance Pool**: Community fund to handle extreme default scenarios
- **Pull Payment Model**: Gas-efficient and reentrancy-safe payout system
- **Reputation System**: Default tracking with automatic member banning
- **Admin Controls**: Emergency functions with strict access controls

### Frontend (Next.js)

- **Modern UI**: Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Web3 Integration**: wagmi + RainbowKit for seamless wallet connections
- **Base Network**: Optimized for fast, low-cost transactions on Ethereum L2
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with glassmorphism effects
- **Real-time Updates**: Live circle status and payment tracking

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Foundry
- Git

### Smart Contract Development

```shell
# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests (33 comprehensive tests)
forge test

# Run tests with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report

# Format code
forge fmt

# Generate gas snapshots
forge snapshot
```

### Frontend Development

```shell
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Environment Setup

Create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_wallet_connect_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=8453
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your_alchemy_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POOLTURN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTICALL3_ADDRESS=0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS=your_usdc_token_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDT_ADDRESS=your_usdt_token_address
```

## üìã How It Works

### 1. Circle Creation
- Creator sets contribution amount, period duration, max members
- Defines collateral factor (1x-10x contribution as security)
- Optional insurance fee for community protection pool

### 2. Member Joining
- Members lock collateral + insurance fee to join
- Circle activates when reaching maximum capacity
- Payout order is set deterministically

### 3. Contribution Rounds
- Members contribute each period (weekly/monthly)
- Winners receive full pot based on rotation
- Defaulters have collateral slashed automatically

### 4. Payout Claims
- Winners can claim payouts using pull payment pattern
- Collateral returned after successful circle completion
- Insurance pool covers extreme scenarios

## üß™ Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with 33 tests covering:

- **Circle Creation**: Parameter validation and initialization
- **Member Management**: Joining, collateral locking, activation
- **Contribution Mechanics**: Payments, defaults, winner selection
- **Payout System**: Claims, collateral withdrawal
- **Admin Functions**: Pause, cancel, emergency procedures
- **Edge Cases**: Insurance pool usage, reputation system
- **Security**: Access control, reentrancy protection

```shell
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test testCreateCircleSuccess

# Run with verbose output
forge test -vv
```
